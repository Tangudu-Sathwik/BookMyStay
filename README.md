# Book My Stay App – Use Case 7

## Overview

This use case allows guests to select optional add-on services for an existing reservation. Services are managed separately to avoid modifying core booking or inventory logic.

* Map reservation IDs to selected services
* Calculate total add-on cost
* Maintain separation from core booking and inventory

## Features

* Service class representing an add-on offering
* AddOnServiceManager to map reservations to services
* Support for multiple services per reservation
* Total add-on cost calculation

## File Structure

* `UseCase7AddOnServiceSelection.java` – Contains reservation, service, and manager logic
